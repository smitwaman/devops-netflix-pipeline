ðŸ‘‰ Step by step access and configuration The Jenkins And SonarQube Servers

1. Jenkins server


With the Ubuntu instance launched and the script for Jenkins and SonarQube installed, letâ€™s access the Jenkins and SonarQube server one at a time.

Weâ€™ll use the public IP address of the Ubuntu instance along with port 8080 and open a new browser to bring up the Jenkins server. The below image illustrates the series of steps for bringing up the Jenkins server. The Jenkinsâ€™ adminstrator password was copied, retrived from its log using the â€˜sudo catâ€™ command, and pasted into the administrator password window to access the Jenkins server.


Weâ€™ll use the â€˜Install suggested pluginsâ€™ to install our Jenkins plugins.
