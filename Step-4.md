ðŸ‘‰ In this step we are going to configure in detailed steps.

1. Prometheus server
2. Node exporter
3. Grafana server

**1. Prometheus server**

To create a system user or system account for Prometheus, run the following command:
```
sudo useradd \
    --system \
    --no-create-home \
    --shell /bin/falso prometheus
```
+
â€” system â€” Will create a system account.
â€” no-create-home â€” We donâ€™t need a home directory for Prometheus or any other system accounts in our case.
â€” shell /bin/false â€” It prevents logging in as a Prometheus user.
Prometheus â€” Will create a Prometheus user and a group with the same name.

Letâ€™s check the latest version of Prometheus from the download page.

+

You can download the latest version or the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

You can also use the curl or wget command to download Prometheus.

```
To avoid permission issues, you need to set the correct ownership for the /etc/prometheus/ and data directory.

$ sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/ /data/://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.47.1/prometheus-2.47.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

+

```
tar -xvf prometheus-2.47.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

```

+

Usually, you would have a disk mounted to the data directory. For this tutorial, I will simply create a /data directory. Also, you need a folder for Prometheus configuration files.

```
sudo mkdir -p /data /etc/prometheus

```

Weâ€™ll change to the Prometheus directory and move some in there.

```
 cd prometheus-2.47.1.linux-amd64/
```

+

Letâ€™s move the Prometheus binary and the promtool to the /usr/local/bin/ directory. The promtool is a command-line utility that provides various tools for checking Prometheus configuration files and data, such as the rule file, alert, time series data inspection, etc.

```
sudo mv prometheus promtool /usr/local/bin/
```

+

Letâ€™s move the console libraries to the Prometheus configuration directory. Console templates allow for the creation of arbitrary consoles using the Go template language. You donâ€™t need to worry about it if youâ€™re just getting started.

```
sudo mv consoles/ console_libraries/ /etc/prometheus/

```

+

Lastly, letâ€™s move the example of the main Prometheus configuration file.

```
sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

+
